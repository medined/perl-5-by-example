  perl.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Do Perl variables have global or local scope by default? 
  <BR><B>Global.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Why is it hard to pass two arrays to a function? <BR><B>Because all

  arrays are combined into one array, the <TT>@_</TT> array.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the difference between variables created with <TT>local()</TT> and 
  variables created with <TT>my()</TT>?<BR><B>The <TT>my()</TT> function creates

  from the current procedure can see. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What does the <TT>map()</TT> function do? <BR><B>This function will 
  evaluate an expression for every element of a given array. The special 
  variable <TT>$_</TT> is assigned each element of the specified array before 
  the expression is evaluated. </B>
  <H3><A name="Chapter 6">Chapter 6</A></H3>

  for the computer to process. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What are the four statement modifiers? <BR><B>if, unless, until, and 
  while</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What are two uses for statement blocks? <BR><B>As a visual device to mark 
  sections of code and a way to create local variables and when you temporarily 
  need to send debugging output to a file. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What can non-action statement be used for? <BR><B>These statements 
  evaluate a value, but perform no actions. Therefore they have little use 
  except to return values from a procedure.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>How is the if modifier different from the unless modifier? <BR><B>The 
  <I>if</I> modifier will tell Perl that the expression should only be evaluated 
  if a given condition is true. The Unless Operator will evaluate an expression 
  unless a condition is true.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What will the following code display?<BR><B>firstVar = 10<BR>secondVar = 
  20</B> </LI></OL>

  <LI>What is the default name of the local variable in the foreach loop? 
  <BR><B>$_</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>How is the <TT>next</TT> keyword different from the <TT>redo</TT> keyword? 
  <BR><B>The <TT>next</TT> keyword is used to skip the rest of the statement 
  block and continue to the next iteration of the loop. The <TT>redo</TT> 
  keyword is used to restart the statement block.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Why is the comma operator useful in the initialization expression of a for 
  loop? <BR><B>Because you can use the comma operator to evaluate two 
  expressions at once in the initialization and the increment/decrement 
  expressions. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the shift() function used for? <BR><B>To value a local variable 
  <I>and </I>remove the first element of the parameter array from the array at

  <P></P>
  <LI>What does the ref() function return if passed a non-reference as a 
  parameter? <BR><B>The <TT>ref()</TT> function returns either a defined or 
  undefined null string depending on which platform you are using - I think.</B> 

  <P></P>
  <LI>What notation is used to dereference a reference value? <BR><B>Curly 
  braces.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is an anonymous array? <BR><B>Anonymous arrays are arrays that are 
  not being assigned directly to a variable. They are only accessible using 
  references.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is a nested data structure? <BR><B>A nested data structure is a data 
  structure that contains another data structure. Frequently, an object needs to 
  contain another object-just like a bag can contain groceries. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What will the following line of code display?<BR><B><PRE>print("${\ref(\(1..5))}");</PRE></B><B>This code will display:

  manipulate files. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is binary mode? <BR><B>In binary mode on DOS systems, line endings 
  are read as two characters-the line feed and the carriage return. On both DOS 
  and UNIX systems, binary mode lets you read the end of file character as 
  regular characters with no special meaning. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is a fully qualified file name? <BR><B>The fully qualified file name 
  includes the name of the disk, the directory, and the file name. </B>

  <LI>Are variables in the computer's memory considered persistent storage? 
  <BR><B>No</B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> operator used for? <BR><B>The 
  <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> characters, when used together, are called the 
  <I>diamond</I> operator. They tell Perl to read a line of input from the file 
  handle inside the operators. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the default file handle for the <TT>printf()</TT> function? 
  <BR><B>The default file handle is <TT>STDOUT</TT>.</B>

     open(FILE_TWO, "&gt;&gt;FILE_TWO.DAT");</PRE></B><B>The &gt; character 
  causes the file to be opened for writing and causes any existing data in the 
  file to be lost. Whereas the &gt;&gt; character sequence will open the file 
  for appending-preserving the existing data. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What value will the following expression return?<BR><B><PRE>     (stat("09lst01.pl"))[7];</PRE></B><B>This expression will return the

  <LI>Why is it important to check for errors? <BR><B>There is only one way to 
  check for errors in any programming language. You need to test the return 
  values of the functions that you call. Most functions return zero or false 
  when something goes wrong. So when using a critical function like 
  <TT>open()</TT> or <TT>sysread()</TT>, checking the return value helps to 
  ensure that your program will work properly. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>How is the <TT>die()</TT> function different from the <TT>warn()</TT> 
  function? <BR><B>The <TT>die()</TT> function is used to quit your script and 
  display a message for the user to read. The <TT>warn()</TT> function has the 
  same functionality that <TT>die()</TT> does except the script is not exited. 
  This function is better suited for non-fatal messages like low memory or disk 
  space conditions. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is the meaning of the <TT>$!</TT> special variable? <BR><B>It helps 
  to find out what happened after an error has occurred. The $! variable can be 
  used in either a numeric or a string context. In a numeric context it holds 
  the current value of <TT>errno</TT>. If used in a string context, it will hold 
  the error string associated with <TT>errno</TT></B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What does the <TT>eval()</TT> function do? <BR><B>The <TT>eval()</TT> 
  function executes its arguments as semi-isolated Perl code. First the Perl 
  code in <TT>$code</TT> is executed and then, if an error arises, the Perl code 
  in <TT>$code</TT> is displayed as text by the <TT>die()</TT> function. </B>

  <LI>What is a signal? <BR><B><I>Signals</I> are messages sent to the process 
  running your Perl script by the operating system. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What will the statement <TT>$SIG{'ABRT'} = 'IGNORE'</TT> do? <BR><B>You 
  can cause Perl to ignore the Ctrl+c key sequence by placing this line of code 
  near the beginning of your program. </B>

  <LI>What is an object? <BR><B>The book you are reading is an object. The knife 
  and fork that you eat with are objects. In short, your life is filled with 
  them. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What is a class? <BR><B>All object oriented techniques use classes to do 
  the real work. A <I>class</I> is a combination of variables and functions 
  designed to emulate an object. However, when referring to variables in a 
  class, object-oriented folks use the term <I>properties</I>. And when 
  referring to functions in a class, the term <I>method</I> is used. </B>

  <LI>What is a property? <BR><B>Variables in a class.</B>

  <LI>What does the term polymorphism mean? <BR><B>A child class can redefine a 
  method already defined in the parent class. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Is the <TT>bless()</TT> function used to create classes? <BR><B>No. The 
  <TT>bless()</TT> function is used to change the data type of the anonymous 
  hash to <TT>$class</TT> or <TT>Inventory_item</TT>.</B> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>What does the <TT>package</TT> keyword do? <BR><B>The <TT>package</TT> 
  keyword is used to introduce new classes and namespaces. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What can a static variable be used for? <BR><B>Static variables can be 
  used to emulate <I>constants</I>-values that don't change. </B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Why is it good to use anonymous hashes to represent objects instead of 
  regular arrays? <BR><B>Child classes, in Perl, will not automatically inherit 
  properties from its parents. However, using anonymous hashes totally avoids 
  this issue because the parent constructor can be explicitly called to create 
  the object. Then, the child can simply add entries to the anonymous hash. </B>

  <LI>How can you create a function that is available to all classes in your 
  script? <BR><B>Start a definition of the <TT>UNIVERSAL</TT> class.</B></LI></OL>

  <LI>What is a symbol table and how are they named? <BR><B>A <I>symbol 
  table</I>, in Perl, is a hash that holds all of the names defined in a 
  namespace. All of the variable and function names can be found there. The hash 
  for each namespace is named after the namespace with two colons. </B>

  <LI>What is a logic error? <BR><B><I>Logic</I> errors are insidious and 
  difficult to find. For example, you might place an assignment statement inside 
  an <TT>if</TT> statement block that belongs outside the block. Or you might 
  have a loop that runs from 0 to 100 when it should run from 10 to 100. 
  Accidentally deleting the 1 or not entering it in the first place is very

  <LI>What is a common error associated with conditional expressions? <BR><B>One 
  of the most common logic problem is using the assignment operator (<TT>=</TT>) 
  when you should use the equality operator (<TT>==</TT>). If you are creating a 
  conditional expression, you'll almost always use the equality operator
