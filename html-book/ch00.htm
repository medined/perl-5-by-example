<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>This book is based on the learn-by-doing principle because I believe simply 
reading about a subject is not the best way to learn. After all, you don't read 
about putting together a jigsaw puzzle, you put the puzzle together yourself! 
Programming is the same way. You must actually run some programs in order to 
really understand the concepts. </P>
<P><I>Perl 5 by Example</I> teaches you how to use the Perl programming language 
by showing examples that demonstrate the concepts being discussed. The examples 
are designed to give you a chance to experiment-which in turn should clarify the 
material. </P>
<P>The topics are covered in a straightforward, non-technical manner which 
allows you to quickly understand the fundamental principles. After the main 
topic of each chapter is introduced, sub-topics are explored in their own 
sections. Each section has its own Perl examples with explanations given in 
psuedocode. 
<P>Each chapter finishes with review questions of varying difficulty based on 
the material in that chapter. The answers usually come from the text or are 
deducible from the text, but occasionally you might need to experiment a little. 
Try to answer the questions at all difficulty levels. If you get stuck turn to 
the answers provided in Appendix A. Also, look at the summary sections after 
reading each chapter and return to them frequently. After you've gone through 
several chapters, you'll begin to understand more often the reason why a concept 
was illustrated or a question was asked. Returning to questions that frustrated 
you earlier and realizing that now you know the answers can be a big confidence 
builder. 
<H2><A name="Who Should Use This Book">Who Should Use This Book?</A></H2><I>Perl 
5 by Example</I> should be read by anyone seeking to learn Perl. If you don't 
know any other programming languages, chapters 2 through 7 will give you a solid 
introduction to the basics. If you already know another language, then skip 
chapters 2 through 7 to see how Perl differs from other languages and start with 
Chapter 8, "<A href="p5be/ch08.htm">References</A>." 
<P>This book follows a simple format. Each chapter contains a single 
topic-usually. First, you read about the topic and then you see examples that 
let you work directly with Perl to understand how the concepts can be applied to 
a program. At the end of each chapter is a summary, followed by review questions 
and exercises. 
<P>This approach is designed to serve a broad range of readers from novice to 
advanced. If you've never programmed before, the learn-by-doing approach will 
help you move quickly and easily though this book. If you have programming 
experience, you'll find plenty of material to refine and enhance what you 
already know, and to give you a solid understanding of how Perl works. 
<H2><A name="What do I Need">What do I Need?</A></H2>In order to effectively use 
this book you need two things. You need a working copy of Perl 5. And you need a 
text editor. That's it. 
<P>You can use the examples in this book with just about any hardware and 
operating system. I'm not sure that they would work on an Amiga system but other 
than that you should be able to run every example. 
<H2><A name="How to Use This Book">How to Use This Book</A></H2>There are 
several ways to use this book. One obvious method is to begin at the first page 
and proceed in order until the last. Most beginning programmers will use this 
method and the book is specifically designed so that each chapter builds on the 
last. Alternatively, you can read up to Chapter 10, "<A 
href="p5be/ch10.htm">Regular Expressions</A>," and then 
skip to Appendix C, "<A href="p5be/xp0c.htm">Function 
List</A>." You can then read specific chapters as needed when your projects 
demand them. Either approach works.

  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=lightpink>It is critical to read through the Perl Command 
      Reference (Appendix C) at least once before starting any major project. 
      Otherwise, you might spend hours developing a function that Perl already 
      has pre-defined. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<H2><A name="Code Listings">Code Listings</A></H2>Many readers prefer to type in 
most of the example code by hand; this helps them focus on the code one line at 
a time. Another good approach is to work through an example in a chapter, close 
the book, and enter it by hand from memory. The struggle that you experience 
will help to deepen your understanding. Remember, getting lost can be how you 
learn to find you way. 
<P>If you're lazy, can't type fast, or are prone to wrist pains like some of my 
friends, you can copy the listings from the CD-ROM that is included at the back 
of this book. Each listing that is on the CD-ROM has a listing header like this: 

<P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=black><FONT color=#fffaa0 size=4><B>Listing 10.1 - 10LST01.PL 
      - This is a Sample Listing Header </B></FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=#fffaa0><B><PRE><BR>
# This is a sample program line.</PRE></B></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The name of the Perl source file will always be the same as the listing's 
number. After each example, experiment a little and see what happens. Change a 
few things, or add a couple, and change the code a bit. This will help you enjoy 
the learning experience more. The most important attribute of a successful 
learning experience is fun. If it is fun and you enjoy it, you will stay with it 
longer. 
<H2><A name=Conventions>Conventions</A></H2>The following conventions are used 
in this book: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Code line, functions, variable names, and any text you see on-screen 
  appear in a special <TT>monospace</TT> typeface. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>File names are also set in a <TT>monospace</TT> typeface. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>New terms are in <I>italic</I>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Case is very important in Perl programming. Always pay attention to 
  upper-case and lower-case in variable and function names. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>If you are required to type text, the text you must type will appear in 
  boldface. For example, "Type <B>perl -w test.pl</B>." Usually, however, the 
  line is set off by itself in a monospace typeface, as shown in the following 
  example: 
  <P></P>
  <P><B><PRE>perl -w test.pl</PRE></B></LI></UL>
<H2><A name=Overview>Overview</A></H2>

program. Chapter 2, "<A href="p5be/ch02.htm">Numeric and 
String Literals</A>," tells you how to explicitly represent non-changeable 
information in your program. Chapter 3, "<A 
href="p5be/ch03.htm">Variables</A>," shows how to

Perl's inherent reporting ability. </P>
<P>Part III, "Advanced Perl," discusses some of the more difficult aspects of 
Perl. Chapter 12, "<A href="p5be/ch12.htm">Using Special 
Variables</A>," lists all of the special variables that you use in Perl and 
shows examples of the more useful ones. Chapter 13, "<A

all of the options that you can use on the command-line that starts Perl. </P>
<P>Part IV, "Perl and the Internet," consists of 5 chapters that look at how 
Perl can be used with the Internet. Chapter 18, "<A 
href="p5be/ch18.htm">Using Internet Protocols</A>," 
discusses several of the protocols commonly used on the Internet-such as FTP, 
SMTP, and POP. Chapter 19, "<A href="p5be/ch19.htm">What 
is CGI?</A>," eases you into writing scripts that can be executed by remote 
users. Chapter 20, "<A href="p5be/ch20.htm">Form

web pages using Perl. Chapter 22, "<A 
href="p5be/ch22.htm">Internet Resources</A>," lists 
several types of Perl resources that are available on the Internet-such as 
Usenet Newsgroups, web sites, and the <TT>#perl</TT> and <TT>#cgi</TT> IRC 
channels. </P>
<P>Appendix A, "<A 
href="p5be/ch01.htm#Review Questions">Review 
Questions</A>," contains answers to the review questions that are at the end of 
every chapter. Try not to peek! Appendix B, "<A
