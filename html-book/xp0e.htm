with this book contains the source pages and reference materials that have been 
referred to throughout the book. The goal of this approach is to allow you to 
cut and paste any applicable code examples so you can quickly re-use them.
<P>The other, perhaps most exciting goal of the CD is to provide new, unique and 
helpful software, shareware and evalutaion software that you can use. To that 
end, you'll find an array of software, including the add-ins, utilities and 
other software packages that we've been able to arrange for you.

  <H2><A name="Using the Electronic Book">Using the Electronic Book</A></H2>Perl 
  By Example is available to you as an HTML document that can be read from any 
  World Wide Web browser that you may have currently installed on your machine 
  (such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator). If you don't have a Web 
  browser, we have included the Microsoft's Internet Explorer for you. The book 
  can also be read on-screen as a Windows Help File.
  <P>
  <H3><A name=" Reading the Electronic Book as an HTML Document">Reading the 
  Electronic Book as an HTML Document</A></H3>To read the electronic book, you 
  will need to start your Web browser and open the document file toc.htmL 
  located on the \HTMLVER subdirectory of the CD. Alternatively, you can browse 
  the CD directory using File Manager and double-click toc.htmL.
  <P>Once you have opened the toc.htmL page, you can access all of the book's 
  contents by clicking on the highlighted chapter number or topic name. The 
  electronic book works like any other Web page; when you click on a hot link, a 
  new page is opened or the browser will take you to the new location in the 
  document. As you read through the electronic book, you will notice other 
  highlighted words or phrases. Clicking on these cross-references will also 
  take you to a new location within the electronic book. You can always use your 
  Browser's forward or backward buttons to return to your original location.
  <P>
  <H3><A name=" Installing the Internet Explorer">Installing the Internet 
  Explorer</A></H3>If you don't have a Web browser installed on your machine, 
  you can use Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 on this CD-ROM.
  <P>The Microsoft Internet Explorer can be installed from the self-extracting 
  file in the \EXPLORER directory. Double-click the MSIE20.exe or use the 
  Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs option and follow the instructions in the 
  install routine. Please be aware you must have Windows 95 installed on your 
  machine to use this version of Internet Explorer. Other versions of this 
  software can be downloaded from Microsoft's Web site at 
  <B>http://www.microsoft.com/ie</B>.
  <P>
  <H2><A name=" Finding Sample Code">Finding Sample Code</A></H2>This book 
  contains code examples that include listing headers, for example, "see Listing 
  10.1", sample documents presented for planning purposes, and items that are 
  indicated with the On the CD icon. For example, consider the following listing 
  reference:
  <P><B><PRE>Listing 10.1  (10_01.htm) -- Creating the new snarfle page....</PRE></B>This 
  listing indicates that this particular code snippet (or example) is included 
  electronically on the CD. To find it, browse to the \CODE subdirectory on the 
  CD and select the file name that matches the one referenced in the listing 
  header from the chapter indicated. In this example, you'd look in the chapter 
  10 subdirectory and open the 10_01.htm file.
