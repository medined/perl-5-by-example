<P>If you've read the rest of this book, you have a fairly good understanding of
Perl. This chapter introduces you to some resources that can take you to the
next level of understanding. You can see which Usenet newsgroups are best to
read, where to find Perl scripts that you can copy and modify for your own use,
and other useful information.
<P>First, you can read about Usenet, a service that uses news articles to
deliver information. You can browse through the newsgroups and pick up useful
information. Additionally, any time you have a question on Perl or CGI
programming you can post the question to a newsgroup. Responses to questions are
usually quick if your subject lines are well thought-out and descriptive.
<P>Next, some Web sites you can visit are listed. They have useful Web, CGI, and
Perl related libraries, sample scripts, and documentation that can be extremely
helpful.

    <TD bgColor=lightpink>If you are new to CGI programming with Perl, you
      will want to visit each of these sites listed in this chapter. Doing this
      will give you a good understanding of what is available to help you become
      a great CGI programmer. As you visit the sites, keep track of useful files
      that can be downloaded that interest you, including their version and the
      date. You might also bookmark the site in your web browser. When you are
      done visiting all the sites, you will know where to access the most recent
      of the tools and you can begin to download and build your own CGI
      development library.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<P>The most useful Perl-related newsgroup is comp.lang.perl.misc because of the
breadth of topics that are covered. This is the newsgroup you will most likely
post to when you are having a Perl language problem or simply have a question
that needs answering.

  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=tomato>It is generally considered poor manners to post your
      question in more than one newsgroup. Most people monitor at least three of
      the four Perl newsgroups and will be annoyed to see your question multiple
      times.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Before you post to any newsgroup. <B>read the Perl FAQ</B>. An <I>FAQ</I> is
a frequently-asked questions document. If you ask a question that is already
answered in the FAQ document, you will be yelled at by other people reading the
list. At all times, remember that you are asking others for their help. They are
under no obligation to help. If you are rude, insulting, unclear, or lazy, you
can expect the same treatment in return. To quote Patrick Swayze in the movie
<I>Roadhouse</I>, "Be polite!"
<P>You can find the FAQ on the <B><A
href="http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/">http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/</A></B> web
page. In addition, this site will point you to other FAQs.
<P>The comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup is very helpful, both to check out what
modules are available and how they are being used, and if you have any questions
or problems with existing Perl modules, or want to ask about the existence of
modules to support a particular need.
<P>The comp.lang.perl.tk newsgroup is a forum to discuss Tk and Perl. <I>Tk</I>
is an interface tool developed by Sun, primarily to use with <I>Tcl</I>, an
embeddable scripting language. There have been Tk extensions made to Perl5 to
allow integration. If you are interesting in using both, you will definitely
want to check out this newsgroup. You can also find a FAQ at the <B><A
href="http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html</A></B>
web page.
<P>Another useful newsgroup is comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi. It will
contain many references to CGI programming using Perl, which is one of the more
popular approaches to CGI. Look at all of the newsgroups beginning with
comp.infosystems.www for those that meet your needs.
<H2><A name="Web Sites">Web Sites</A></H2>The following sites are good places to
visit to build up your Perl and/or CGI script library. In addition, the sites
will begin to give you an idea of what exactly already exists that you can use,
or modify for your own use. You will be amazed at what is available that is
either freeware or shareware.

be prepared to wait a little bit while downloading. Around the end of July, the
server was having difficulties staying up - hopefully they have been resolved by
the time you read this.
<P>However, when the site is available, it has valuable information. You should
definitely stop in and browse.

<P>This attractive and very useful site contains links to many fairly
sophisticated CGI scripts. For example, Web Chat 1.0 contains a slide show
script, guest book, a complete shopping cart example, and many others. This site
not only provides the sample scripts but you can also see them in action and

Databases, and Style Guidelines. This site is an incredibly rich source of links
to virtually any web development-related topic you can think of. The CGI page
has 69 links, the HTML has 55 links, and so on. This site is definitely a must

<P>I believe that ActiveWare has the most advanced and stable Perl
implementation for Windows 95 and Windows NT. They have also made a DLL
available to let Perl work with the Microsoft Internet Information Server. This
library will work with the Microsoft Internet Information Server to improve the
efficiency of CGI access with Perl. Note that the release of this DLL may still
be a beta release.

<P>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network is a set of web sites that mirror one
other. The network is a volunteer organization so don't expect a lot of
documentation and hand-holding. At each site, there is a sub-directory labeled
<TT>/modules</TT> which will contain references to various Perl modules that are
stored there. To access a list of the modules look at the
<TT>/modules/01modules.index.html</TT> web page. Module development guidelines
can be found at <TT>/modules/00modlist.long.html</TT>. In addition, the modules
are listed by author, category, and by module.
<P>Also, check out the <TT>/scripts</TT> sub-directory. This sub-directory is
itself sub-divided into more directories, each representing a different
category. Each category has scripts that can be examined, used, and modified.

<P>Tim Bunce, the author of Dbperl says, "DBperl is a database access
Application Programming Interface (API) for the Perl Language. The DBperl API
Specification defines a set of functions, variables and conventions that provide
a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used."
With DBperl you can access the following databases: Oracle, Sybase, mSQL,
Informix, and Quickbase. Plans are currently underway to implement an interface
for ODBC.

<H2><A name="Internet Relay Chat, or IRC">Internet Relay Chat, or
IRC</A></H2>The Internet Relay Chat service is a powerful tool. If you're lucky
you can connect with very knowledgeable people who will answer your questions.
The advantage of IRC is that you can hold a real-time conversation with other
people. You ask a question, they respond. You can then ask for clarification or
actually try the advice. If you still have a problem, you can ask for more
advice.
<P>There are several networks that have arisen to support IRC: EfNet, Undernet,
and DALnet. The Perl gurus hang out on EfNet. The <TT>#perl</TT> IRC channel is
a good place to go for general Perl questions. If you have basic questions, you
can try <TT>#perl-basics</TT>. CGI questions should be directed to
<TT>#cgi</TT>.
<P>The Windows 95 program mIRC has been included on the CD that accompanies this
book. Install it and try connecting to one of the EfNet servers. I like to use
<TT>irc.cris.com</TT>. Once connected - keep trying; it may take a few tries -
<TT><B>type /join #perl</TT></B> and say hello to everyone. You might even see
me - my nickname is WasWaldo.

<H2><A name=Summary>Summary</A></H2>You've finally the end of the journey that
was mentioned in Chapter 1,"<A
href="ch01.htm">Getting Your Feet Wet</A>" . I hope
you enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. While I was doing
research, I took advantage of every resource listed in this chapter. If you have
unanswered questions, I urge you to ask them either in IRC or the relevant
newsgroup. With today's fast communications it doesn't make sense to hold up a
project when the answer might available in minutes or hours.
<P>The easiest resource to use is the Usenet newsgroups. Simply send a message
to an appropriate newsgroup with a carefully worded subject line before you
leave work for the evening. The odds are good that you will have a response by
the next morning. Most of time you should use the <TT>comp.lang.perl.misc</TT>
newsgroup.
<P>When you have some unruly code that should work but doesn't. Consider looking
on the Perl home page (<B><A
href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</A></B>) to see if a new bug
has been found.
<P>If you need ideas or would like to get a head start on your next programming
project, you can search for Perl programs at the Yahoo (<B><A
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Perl/">http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Perl/</A></B>)
web site. By starting at the Yahoo site, you always see an updated list of
available Perl resources. Some sites (like Dale Dewley's - <B><A
href="http://www.engr.iupui.edu/~dbewley/perl/">http://www.engr.iupui.edu/~dbewley/perl/</A></B>)
has resources that you will refer to over and over again.
<P>Sometimes, you absolutely can't wait for an answer. When you have pressing
deadlines or your brain is frazzeled, turn to the #perl channel on an Efnet IRC
server.
<P>At this point there's nothing left to say but...
<P>Happy Programing!
